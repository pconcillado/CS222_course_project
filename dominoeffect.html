        <h2>How do they correlate?</h2>
        <h5>Domino Effect: Hypertension, Diabetes, and Kidney Disease</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><u>Hypertension to Kidney Disease:</u> Hypertension damages the blood vessels in the kidneys over time, reducing their ability to effectively filter waste effectively. High blood pressure can reduce the amount of oxygen that the vital organs receive. The kidneys are very sensitive, so if they consistently do not meet the oxygen demand due to hypertension affecting circulation, this can lead to CKD.</li>
          <li><u>Kidney Disease to Hypertension:</u> Kidneys play a crucial role in regulating blood pressue through producing an enzyme called renin. Renin is released when the kidneys detect a drop in blood pressure or low sodium levels. Damaged kidneys release too much renin which constricts the blood vessels and causes hypertension. <i>Notice how kidney disease and hypertension are closely linked that they affect each other both ways.</i></li>
          <li><u>Diabetes to Kidney Disease:</u> Uncontrolled diabetes leads to high blood sugar levels, which damage the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys. Imagine that too much sugar thickens the blood so that causes extra strain on both the heart and blood vessels. This is a primary cause of kidney disease, known as diabetic nephropathy. <i>The patients that are on dialysis very often have diabetes as one of their diagnosis. </i></li>
          <li><u>Hypertension and Diabetes Together:</u> Hypertension and diabetes often coexist, and their combined effects significantly accelerate kidney damage, leading to CKD. <i>They do not directly cause one another but the presence of one can exacerbate the other.</i></li>
        </ul>

      <h2> Overall Health Complications: </h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). The trio raises the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other heart problems.</li>
          <li>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Progression: </li>
          <li>Reduced Quality of Life: Fatigue, frequent hospitalizations, and emotional distress affect daily life.</li>
          <li>Healthcare Costs: High expenses from medications, dialysis, and doctor visits.</li>
          <li>Loss of Productivity: Chronic illness leads to missed workdays, early retirement, and reduced income. </li>
          <li>Epidemic Scale: Rising rates due to obesity, sedentary lifestyles, and aging populations.</li>
      </ul>

          <h2>How to Prevent the Disease Trio</h2>
          <li>Healthy Diet
            <ul>Eat fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. As well as, limit salt and sugar.<u>You are what you eat!</u></ul>
          </li>
          <li>Exercise
            <ul>Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week. Being active can help your body function and improve circulation!</ul></li>
          <li>Blood Pressure
            <ul>Keep it under 120/80 mm Hg with healthy habits and medication if needed. Try to avoid foods high in sodium!</ul></li>
          <li>Control Blood Sugar
            <ul>Maintain a balanced diet, exercise, and monitor blood glucose levels. </ul></li>
          <li>Avoid Smoking & Limit Alcohol
            <ul>Both are risk factors as they damage the body's function and slows it down. It also adds extra waste for the kidneys to clean up, so don't!</ul></li>
          <li>Regular Check-Ups
            <ul>Get health screenings to catch early signs of problems. <i>The NMC Nursing Club conducts health screenings for blood pressure and blood glucose, JOIN!</i></ul></li>
          <li>Manage Stress
            <ul>Use techniques like meditation to lower stress.</ul></li>
